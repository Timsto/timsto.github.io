Welcome to my personal blog about Microsoft Azure solutions! 
i start my carrer back in 2014 at a small digital agenancy in Germany and make an training as "Fachinformatiker - System integration". During this training i had the big advantage of being able to work in all areas of IT. This means i work in project abouts Network, Backup, Security and at least Identity which brings me to the point to work with Microsoft Azure Achtive Directory. 
Over this time i gain a lot of experience in leading own project and was able to lead the migration from onpremise AD, Exchange and Skype for Business to AzureAD and Office365. l

Over the time i contribute to different forums and online communities and decide back in 2015 to start the "**Office 365 Meetup Wuppertal**" Community. On out first Meetup we watch together Microsoft Event "MS Build" and had much fun. Be sure this meetup will be reactivated soon!!! - Maybe

After taking my first Microsoft Azure Certification "Azure Administrator" (still the old way over 70-533) and take my social profiles update to date, the day which brings my life to the next level appears. After a long workday, my phone blinks up and show me a notification from Linkedin about a message from a recruiter.  i was a little bit curious after i read the job opportunity to work for Microsoft as a **Premier Field Engineer** (now Customer Engineer). My First thought was that this is a fake. This cant be really, because i just finish my training 2 weeks before.
But yeah. i wasn´t a fake. After some mails and call, i was invated to flight to Dublin for my Job interview. It was so cool to sit in the new Office in Dublin and to know that if i master both interviews and the approval from Microsoft, my entry life will be changed.
And today i a can say.  It was great and makes me proud to achive the dream to work for this great company!

Today, with my new job at semperis, i work 99% from home and support customers with their Identity Landscape around **Entra ID** and building programs/automations for better handling their Cloud infrastructure.
