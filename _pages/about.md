Welcome to my personal blog about Microsoft Azure solutions! i wrote on myself and not as a Microsoft employee. 

i start my carrer back in 2014 at a small digital agenancy in Germany and make an training as "Fachinformatiker - System integration". During this training i had the big advantage of being able to work in all areas of IT. This means i work in project abouts Network, Backup, Security and at least Identity which brings me to the point to work with Microsoft Azure Achtive Directory. 
Over this time i gain a lot of experience in leading own project and was able to lead the migration from onpremise AD, Exchange and Skype for Business to AzureAD and Office365. l

Over the time i contribute to different forum and online communities and decide back in 2015 to start the "**Office 365 Meetup Wuppertal**" Community. On out first Meetup we watch together Microsoft Event "MS Build" and had much fun. Be sure this meetup will be reactivated soon!!! 

After taking my first Microsoft Azure Certification "Azure Administrator" (still the old way over 70-533) and take my social profiles update to date, the day which brings my life to the next level appears. After a long workday, my phone blinks up and show me a notification from Linkedin about a message from a recruiter.  i was a little bit curious after i read the job opportunity to work for Microsoft as a **Premier Field Engineer** (now Customer Engineer). My First thought was that this is a fake. This cant be really, because i just finish my training 2 weeks before. 
But yeah. i wasnt a fake. After some mails and call, i was invated to flight to Dublin for my Job interview. It was so cool to sit in the new Office in Dublin and to know that if i master both interviews and the approval from Microsoft, my entry life will be changed. 
And today i a can say.  It was great and makes me proud to achive the dream to work for this great company! 

Today i work mainly from home and support customers with their Identity Landscape around **Azure Active Directory** and building programs/automations for better handling their Cloud infrastructure.
