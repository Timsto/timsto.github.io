# 1 Year Semperis

15 Months ago, i informed my Manager at Microsoft that i will leave the company. At this time i was really unhappy with the situation with my previous role and the lack of groth opportunities in Germany and still stay technical. But luckly i meet a fanatasic person, who convinced me to join Semperis. So a few weeks later with the begining of Karneval in Germany, i started my new role as a Senior Solutions Architect at Semperis.

And it was the best decision i made in my career so far.

## Why Semperis?

At the beginning of my career, there was one topic that i hate the most.

**Backup and Recovery**

Now i´m in a company that is all about Backup and Disaster Recovery for Active Directory and Entra ID.
But i love it now and see how much important it is to have a good Disaster Recovery Plan for your Identity Infrastructure. Plus i can evolve the future of Identity Resiliancy with Semperis and help customers to protect their crown jewels.

## What happend in the last year?

Beside the topic that i need to learn a lot about Active Directory in gerneral and the semperis products, i have the change to finialy focus on the stuff that i love the most.

**Entra ID**

With Products like DRET and DSP for Entra ID, i can now focus on the cloud identity security recovery and make sure that we are on the right track and help customers to protect their Entra ID environments.

Beside that, i had the change to speak at some great conferences like **Hybrid Identity Protection**, **WPNinja Summit**, **Techorama** and many more.

Thanks to my manager to give me the time and freddom to realize that!

Following some impression from the events:
