# Use 1Password as MFA Method for AzureAD

Unlocking your Device every time for agree the MFA prompt could be really annoying, even when you are working like a consult for different companies.
During my late night session working for different customers, it was a real pain to unlock, hold my face in front of the device and press "agree" every time i log into my customer environment, especially then you need to do MFA every time you sign in over CLI.

## Security Concerns

Yes there are some security benefits not to fall back to software token and using Microsoft Authentificator app or something similar, i think its save enough to use Software Token, unless you are not working with the highest privileged account like Global Administrator.

### Step by Step

1. Log into [aka.ms/mysecurityinfo](aka.ms/mysecurityinfo) and register a new MFA Method. Choose **"Authenticator app"**

8. Add **OTP** as a bew field
