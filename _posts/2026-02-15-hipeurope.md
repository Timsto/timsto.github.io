# Hybrid Identity Protection Europe 2026

My first event in 2026 was the Hybrid Identity Protection Europe in the middle of Germany. The Host town Frankfurt make a perfect location, to bring all European Identity Experts together. With around 160 attendees, the event was more then sold out and the atmosphere was great.

My orignial plan was to be there as a normal attendee and meet some colleges and old customer friends, but 12 Hours before the event i get the question if i can jump in for a speaker who can not make it. Luckily i am well aware with the topic and had also a session already prepared. But yes that is bit challanging as a big part of the presentation was a demonstatrion which must be setup. Let say the lab was ready 1 minute before the session start and i already stand on the stage. But i think it was a good session and the audience was happy with the content. a Lot of people came to me after the session and ask for more details about the demo and the topic in general.

## Rethink traditional PAW

Privileged Access Workstations (PAW) are a common security concept from many years ago. But now it is time to rethink and modernize this concept. With the new features in Entra ID and Windows 11, we can achieve a much better security level.  Zero Trust, Fido Keys and different signals from the device and the user can help us to protect our privileged accounts much better. In my session i show you how to implement a modern PAW concept with Entra ID and Windows 11.

## Nashville 2026

In September 2026 will be the next HIP in Nashville, USA. I am already looking forward to this event and hope to see many of you there.
