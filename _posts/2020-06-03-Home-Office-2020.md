# Home Office Setup 2020

Normally i travel a lot for my daily work and just sitting at my Home Office Setup during the night for some coding or gaming session.  But during this unnormal time (COVID-19), i work 100% from Home and thats why i upgrade some stuff.  

And thats why i wanna share you my Home Setup today:

![](../content/lametric.jpg)

## Quick overview

+ 6 years old Gaming PC for Gaming and private Work. After all the years, it still fits to my needs (maybe because of the Server CPU and high end GPU :D )  

+ My Main work Machine is a **Surface Book 2 15-inch**, which is perfect for building little Demo Laps and playing games on the Road.  

+ Both are connected to my **Dell UltraSharp 34 Monitor U3419W**. The Feature i like most is the integrated USB-Hub, where i can connect all wired stuff to both devices without replug.   

+ On every Device i use the **FrancyZones** feature in the PowerToys Suite. With it, it is possible to made the best out of the Ultrawide Screen.  

+ The newest Baby at my Setup is the **Jarvis Standing Desk** with an Ikea table top. This is a dream for my back, because now i can stand up during delivering remote workshops.  

+ For my Accessories i use the **MX Master 2** and the **Surface Modern Keyboard with FinterprintID**. For my sound setup I have different Headsets (**Bose QuietComfort 35 II** + **Tbone SC440**, **HyperX cloud ii**)  

+ For Video i use an **Logitech C920 HD Pro** Webcam.  

+ Around my Desk i have some **Philips Hue** lamps, which made a big quality differents for video and my personal feels during the day. Furthermore in the night i can switch the normal light color to some fancy color setups.  

+ Something that i would miss if it would not be there is my **Alexa Echo Dot** for my home automation and a **LaMetric Time**, to Display the Time and quick snakes games during Work.  

+ Behind my Chair is a little rack, where i had installed my network and Lab gear

## Some parts i wanna updated in the near future

+ Unifi Dreammachine Pro
+ Small Lab System like a Intel NUC
